**Key Learning**: Importance of documentation and version control

### **Step 10: Production Docker Setup**

- ✅ Cloned repository to VPS in proper location (`/var/www/`)
- ✅ Created production Docker Compose configuration
- ✅ Built and deployed all containers (MySQL, Django, React)

**Challenges Encountered & Solved**:

- ❌ Environment variable loading during Docker build
- ✅ **AI Solution**: Moved environment loading to runtime
- ❌ TypeScript compilation errors in production
- ✅ **AI Solution**: Include dev dependencies for build process
- ❌ MySQL authentication and initialization
- ✅ **AI Solution**: Proper environment variable configuration
- ❌ Container health check failures
- ✅ **AI Solution**: Simplified deployment by removing health checks

### **Step 11: Database & Application Setup**

- ✅ Ran Django migrations in production
- ✅ Created Django superuser
- ✅ Collected static files for production serving

### **Step 12: Final Nginx Configuration**

- ✅ Removed test HTML files
- ✅ Installed production Nginx configurations
- ✅ Enabled sites for both domain and subdomain
- ✅ Restarted Nginx with new configurations

**Final Result**: ✨ **LIVE APPLICATION** ✨

- **Frontend**: https://testingonvps.online
- **API**: https://api.testingonvps.online
- **Admin**: https://api.testingonvps.online/admin/
