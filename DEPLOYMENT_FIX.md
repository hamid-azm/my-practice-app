# 🚨 DEPLOYMENT ERROR FIX

## Problem: Environment Variables Not Found During Docker Build

**Error**: `DB_NAME not found. Declare it as envvar or define a default value.`

## ✅ **Fixed!**

The issue was that Django was trying to load environment variables during the Docker build process, but those variables are only available when the container runs.

### **What I Fixed:**

1. **Removed `collectstatic` from Dockerfile** - Now runs after container starts
2. **Added default values** to Django settings for database configuration
3. **Added proper static files configuration** for production

### **Updated Files:**
- ✅ `backend/Dockerfile.production` - Removed collectstatic from build
- ✅ `backend/myproject/settings.py` - Added default values and production config

## 🚀 **Now Try Deployment Again:**

```bash
# On your VPS, try the deployment again
cd /var/www/my-practice-app

# Pull the latest fixes
git pull origin main

# Build and start containers (should work now)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up --build -d

# Wait for containers to start
sleep 30

# Setup database (collectstatic runs here, not during build)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml exec backend python manage.py migrate
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml exec backend python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

# Check if containers are running
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps
```

## 🔍 **If You Still Get Errors:**

### **Check environment file:**
```bash
cat .env.production
```
Make sure it contains all required variables.

### **Check container logs:**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs backend
```

### **Check if containers are running:**
```bash
docker ps
```

## ✅ **The Fix Explained:**

**Before**: Django tried to load production environment variables during Docker build → ❌ Failed

**After**: Django uses default values during build, then loads real environment variables when container starts → ✅ Success

Now your deployment should work! 🎉
